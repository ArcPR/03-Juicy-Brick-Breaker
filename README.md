## Implementation

1. Handmade sprite for the paddle that "highlights" when hit by the ball
2. Handmade sprite for the ball that "highlights" when hitting any object
3. Implemented music, "Clair De Lune" (see references below for source). Meant to fit the calm colors along with the game being more relaxed.
4. Hit sound for the ball hitting the paddle (see below)
5. Sound for the bricks being hit (see below)
6. Handmade sprite for the bricks
7. Handmade sprite for the power-up.

Remember to put in confetti particles for the paddle (exercise 3a video), and 1 other thing (bricks falling in, possible tweening, etc.)

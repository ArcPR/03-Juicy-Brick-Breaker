Description


## Implementation

1. Handmade sprite for the paddle that "highlights" when hit by the ball
2. Handmade sprite for the ball that "highlights" when hitting any object
3. Implemented music, "Clair De Lune" (see references below for source). Meant to fit the calm colors along with the game being more relaxed.
4. Hit sound for the ball hitting the paddle (see below)
5. Sound for the bricks being hit (see below)
6. Handmade sprite for the bricks
7. Handmade sprite for the power-up. Meant to look menacing and bright compared to the rest of the features to stand out. 
8. Water shader used in the menu

The main theme I was going for here was a more casual, relaxed game. Every color seen uses some shade of blue, purple, pink, or a mix of the three (besides the power-up, which is meant to be eye-catching). You see a water shader when you boot up the game's home screen, and the music chosen was also meant to be relaxed. Overall I took this project to also test my creativeness with sprite making, since it's something I have very little experience in.
